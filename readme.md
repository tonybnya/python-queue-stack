# Python Queue and Stack.

# Using lists to modeling behavior of these Data Structures.

## Queue

A Queue is a linear Data Structure using the principle of `FIFO` to handle data.

`FIFO` stands for `First In First Out`.

Time Complexity: O(1)

#

## Stack

A Stack is a linear Data Structure using the principle of `LIFO` or `FILO` to handle data.

`LIFO` stands for `Last In First Out.`

`FILO` stands for `First In Last Out.`

Time complexity: O(1)

`queue.py` - Python script for the Queue.

`stack.py` - Python script for the stack.

`simulation.py` - Python script in which I use two stacks to simulate a queue.
